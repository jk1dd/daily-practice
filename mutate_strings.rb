# I will give you two strings. I want you to transform stringOne into stringTwo one letter at a time.
#
# Example:
#
# stringOne = 'bubble gum';
# stringTwo = 'turtle ham';
#
# Result:
# bubble gum
# tubble gum
# turble gum
# turtle gum
# turtle hum
# turtle ham

# store (puts?) the intermediate strings

def mutate_my_strings(s1,s2)
  #your code here
end
